# TODO: automate fetching stats https://github.com/ai/browserslist#custom-usage-data
# See: https://github.com/ai/browserslist/issues/71
# Right now we have manually compiled report in a Gist (see package.json "stats" entry)
# and it's used for autoprefixer
> 0.5% in my stats

> 2% in PL

# Exceptions:
#
# Always describe exceptions!
#
# Always measure how much more the the compiled stylesheet weights
# when exception is added (you may use `du` for that) and check if
# exception is justified
#
# Always run `browserslist` cli tool (npm i -g browserslist-cli) to
# see if declaration you add results in correct resolution
